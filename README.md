# Oxy Macro Format

> [!NOTE]
> I've decided that I will release the documentation first and later complete the reference decoder/encoder for both [Hydro](https://github.com/EESports7/Hydro) andÂ Oxy.   
> I might make a FAQ section if I feel the need to.   
> If you have any questions, feel free to make an issue request.   

This format focuses entirely on size, but the performance isn't *the worse*. This format uses a combination of [Zstandard compression](https://github.com/facebook/zstd), [vu128 variable integers](https://john-millikin.com/vu128-efficient-variable-length-integers), and grouped input types to optimize for size. An added bonus of grouped inputs is the ability to multithread parsing each input in parallel. Ideally, this format **should be implemented along side [Hydro](https://github.com/EESports7/Hydro)** because this format does not save inputs that happen multiple times in a single frame in a lossless manner. (See [this section](https://github.com/EESports7/Oxy/edit/main/README.md#sub-frame-logic) for more info)

### Macro Data (Compressed)

This should be the only data compressed if compression is used

```

std::vector<PlayerPos> playerSpawn;          // First position is the starting position, contains where the player spawns for each attempt on replay
std::vector<double> tps;                     // First TPS is the starting TPS

// All of these vectors in this block contain frame deltas encoded using vu128

std::vector<uint32_t> P2RIGHTSWIFT;           //

// These variables should only be read if indicated by the bitmask
uint8_t physicsFreq = 1;                     // Defaults to 1
std::vector<PhysicsState> player1States;     //
std::vector<PhysicsState> player2States;     //
```

# Sub-Frame Logic

In order to mitigate most issues concerning this method of storing macro data, addition logic is needed. First and foremost, the first step is to include an additional swift click input type. (It should be known that swift click shouldn't trigger the sub-frame logic check.) Importantly, macros should contain an equal amount of clicks and releases, and if this isn't true, a release can be safely added on the same frame before the next click. In theory, this would limit the first input to be a release on a frame, followed by any number of swift clicks, and ending in a click. (See table below) Concerning the order of platformer and player clicks, this shouldn't matter too much so to standardize, it should be in the order of the input values listed above.

This only concerns decoding, not encoding.

## Singular Frame Example

Correct

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Input 4 |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Release | Swift   | Swift   | Click   |

Incorrect   

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Input 4 |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Click   | Swift   | Swift   | Click   |

Incorrect   

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Input 4 |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Click   | Swift   | Swift   | Release |
